## Hi, I'm Dominic!


<p>
<span style="font-size:0.8em">
	I am currently a first-year PhD student in Department of Biostatistics in the T.H Chan School of Public Health at 	Harvard University. I previously received my Bachelor's of Science in Neuroscience and my Master's of Science in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh, concurrently working for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and later in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System.

<p>
<span style="font-size:0.8em">
	I am still (always) developing my interests within biostatistics, but I am currently curious about causal inference in settings with missing, misspecified, or otherwise imperfect data. My previous research experience includes clinical prediction model development and implementation science work in the Veterans Affairs Hospital System.

#### Background
<p>
<span style="font-size:0.8em">
	I received both my Bachelor's of Science in Neuroscience and my Master's of Science in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh. While studying neuroscience, I worked as a data analyst in a lab studying long-term outcomes among individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), including the development of a prediction model of seizure events following TBI and studies seeking to understand the effects of extracranial injury on suicidal ideation in long-term survivors with TBI.

<p>
<span style="font-size:0.8em">
While working as an analyst, I began my master's studies in August 2019 in teh
During my master's in June 2020, I joined the Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. Within this role, I worked on the quantitative team to support state-wide implementation of new interventions for healthy aging as well as retrospective studies of utilization and effects of outpatient hospice care in the VA. In December 2020, I graduated with my Master's in Biostatistics, after which I continued my role in the VA until August 2022 when I began my PhD program.
