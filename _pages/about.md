My name is Dominic DiSanto. I am currently employed a statistician in the Pittsburgh Veterans Affairs' [Center for Health Equity Research & Promotion](https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/centers/cherp.cfm) and work as a graduate research assistant with Dr. Ravi Patel in the University of Pittsburgh's School of Pharmacy. More information on my background and details related to my work can be found in the **[Education](/education/)** & **[Experience](/experience/)** sections of this site.  

I received both my Bachelor's in Neuroscience and my Master's in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh. While studying neuroscience, I worked as a student research assistant in a lab studying the long-term outcome of individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Data Analyst in the same lab. While working as an analyst, I began my master's studies in August 2019, graduating with my Master's in Biostatistics in December 2020.
