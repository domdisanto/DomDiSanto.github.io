*This page is a brief outline of my path to (bio)statistics and of my undergraduate and master's studies. For a quick outline of my experience rather than my <strike> rambling </strike> long-form writing, see my <a href="/education"> Education </a> and <a href="/experience/">Experience</a> pages.*

#### Background
<p>
<span style="font-size:0.8em">
	I received both my Bachelor's of Science in Neuroscience and my Master's of Science in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh. While studying neuroscience, I worked as a student research assistant in a lab studying the long-term outcome of individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I worked full-time for the same research group as a Data Analyst. While working as an analyst, I began my master's studies in August 2019, graduating with my Master's in Biostatistics in December 2020.
