<p>
	I received both my Bachelor's in Neuroscience and my Master's in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh. While studying neuroscience, I worked as a student research assistant in a lab studying the long-term outcome of individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I worked full-time for the same research group as a Data Analyst. While working as an analyst, I began my master's studies in August 2019, graduating with my Master's in Biostatistics in December 2020.
