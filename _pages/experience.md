## Projects, Skills, & Interests

### <img src="/assets/images/VA.png" width="48"/> <span style="font-size:0.8em">Statistician,  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs<span style="font-size:0.8em">

##### <em> General Roles </em>

- <span style="font-size:0.8em">  Big data management and analysis of Veteran data  </span>
- <span style="font-size:0.8em"> Visualization and presentation of data completion, validity </span>
- <span style="font-size:0.8em"> Statistician on prospective quality improvement programs and retrospective cohort studies </span>
- <span style="font-size:0.8em"> Creation of training materials for new employee onboarding and data documentation for new data sources </span>



##### <em> Implementation Work </em>

<span style="font-size:0.8em">
  Within the VA, I serve on the quantitative team for the VA's [<b>S</b>afer <b>A</b>ging through <b>G</b>eriatrics-informed <b>E</b>vidence-based practices (SAGE) quality improvement program](https://www.cherp.research.va.gov/partners/VISN4_SAGE_QUERI.asp). As this project is currently in the pre-implementation phase, much of my work involves data management to identify cohorts of eligible Veterans and inform the specific clinics involved in randomization for each included intervention (also referred to as evidence-based practices). Final analysis during and following this project will include the treatment effects of each intervention on mortality rate and the number of "facility-free days", or days a Veteran is able to spend within their own private residence (i.e. no admitted to a hospital, nursing facility, or other domiciliary care).
</span>


##### <em> Research Projects </em>

<span style="font-size:0.8em">
  I additionally work as a statistician on two research teams who are leading retrospective-cohort studies. The first project assesses the current utilization and effectiveness of outpatient palliative care among Veterans with life-limiting conditions, with a secondary aim of assessing unhealth prescribing in older, end-of-life Veterans. The second project studies the effects of recently implemented eScreening tools for mental health disorders and suicidal ideation, specifically studying Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans who are newly enrolled in the VA healthcare system.
</span>


##### <em> Data & Study  Management </em>

<span style="font-size:0.8em">
  Beyond my statistician role, I additionally work with Dr. Chantele Mitchell-Miland to design, create, and manage study databases for CHERP-affiliated researchers who are leading prospective research studies and/or small-scale trials. This database management work includes collaboration with investigators as well as study coordinators and research assistants to optimize data entry efficiency during Veteran visits and to report data capture and visit completion rates.
</span>

### <img src="/assets/images/seal.png" width="48"/> Data Science Education Consultant, School of Pharmacy

<span style="font-size:0.8em">
  The University of Pittsburgh's School of Pharmacy curriculum includes a [PharmacoAnalytics](https://www.pharmacy.pitt.edu/programs/grad/pharmacoanalytics.php) track/concentration as well as a number of data management and analysis related coursework. Dr. Ravi Patel, who leads the course *Python for Data Management & Analytics* within the school, and I have developed and are continuing to contribute to a [public-facing site](https://domdisanto.github.io/Python_OER/) of education materials related to data science and machine learning.  
</span>

<span style="font-size:0.8em">
  These materials target audiences with varying levels of comfort with Python, including first-time Python users learning and applying new skills or those with familiarity to practice and demonstrate their skills in relevant use-cases. Applied materials (including use cases and available data, either simulated or publicily hosted) are specifically tailored to business and/or clinical use-cases in pharmacy.
</span>

<span style="font-size:0.8em">
  This work specitically first included the [curated aggregation](https://domdisanto.github.io/Python_OER/2--Resource-List.html) of public and/or open-source Python and statistical education resources such as textbooks, lectures, programs, blogs, etc.
</span>

<span style="font-size:0.8em">
  Beyond curating these currently-existing materials, Dr. Patel and I met with pharmacists and data scientists in practice to create projects and assignments that mirror data and business problems seen in practice. This involved the simulation of shareable data that mirrors the idiosyncrasies (including random and non-random missingness, seasonal and temporal trends, and the presence of superfluous or incorrect data) seen in each specific use-case.
