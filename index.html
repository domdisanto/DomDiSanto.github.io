	  <h3> Hi!</h3>
	  <p>
	    Below is a brief bio of my interests, experience, and path from neuroscience to statistics. More detailed information can be found within the respective <a href="/education/">Education</a> & <a href="/experience/">Experience</a> sections of my site. The <a href="/experience/">Experience</a> section contains my work experience in addition to relevant project experience and a list of publications

		I am currently a statistician in the <a href="https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/centers/cherp.cfm">Center for Health Equity Research & Promotion</a> within the Pittsburgh Veterans Affairs hosopital network. I concurrently work as a graduate research assistant with Dr. Ravi Patel in the University of Pittsburgh's School of Pharmacy, focusing on Python and statistics education for pharmacy students interested in data analysis or within the schools' PharmacoAnalytics concentration.

		I received both my Bachelor's in Neuroscience and my Master's in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh. While studying neuroscience, I worked as a student research assistant in a lab studying the long-term outcome of individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I worked full-time for the same research group as a Data Analyst. While working as an analyst, I began my master's studies in August 2019, graduating with my Master's in Biostatistics in December 2020.
