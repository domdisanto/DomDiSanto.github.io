	  <h3> Hi !</h3>
	  <span style="font-size:0.8em"> 
	  <p>
    Thanks for coming to my personal & professional website. The site currently serves mostly to present my academic and professional experience and interests in biostatistics. I also include information relevant to my background and current skill set. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
    Information about my professional and academic research can be found in the <a href="/experience/"> Experience </a> page, which details my work-related projects and lists my current publications. Unfortunately (but understandably), much of my current code and work in the VA cannot be shared publicly, but some of my previous projects are hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/domdisanto/">GitHub profile</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Included in the <a href="/about/">About</a> page is a brief bio of my interests, experience, and path from neuroscience to statistics, and the <a href="/education/">Education</a> page more explicitly outlines my timeline and background.
