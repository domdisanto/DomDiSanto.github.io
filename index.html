	  <h3> Hi, I'm Dominic!</h3>
	  <span style="font-size:0.8em">

    Thanks for coming to my personal & professional website. The site currently serves mostly to present my academic and professional experience and interests in biostatistics. I also include information relevant to my background and current skill set.
	  </p>

    More information about my background can be found on my <a href="/about/"> About Me </a> page. A list of my publications is available on the <a href="/research/"> Research </a> page. Much of my work during my time at the VA cannot be shared publicly, but some of my previous projects are hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/domdisanto/">GitHub profile</a> and details about my projects available in the  <a href="/experience/"> Experience </a> section.
