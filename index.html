		I am currently a statistician in the <a href="https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/centers/cherp.cfm">Center for Health Equity Research & Promotion</a> within the Pittsburgh Veterans Affairs hosopital network. I concurrently work as a graduate research assistant with Dr. Ravi Patel in the University of Pittsburgh's School of Pharmacy, focusing on Python and statistics education for pharmacy students interested in data analysis or within the schools' PharmacoAnalytics concentration.
