		I received both my Bachelor's in Neuroscience and my Master's in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh. While studying neuroscience, I worked as a student research assistant in a lab studying the long-term outcome of individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Data Analyst in the same lab. While working as an analyst, I began my master's studies in August 2019, graduating with my Master's in Biostatistics in December 2020.
