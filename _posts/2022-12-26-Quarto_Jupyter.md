I spent a bit of extra time playing with Quarto in Jupyter Lab, and produced the PDF below with some example code and graph for a given causal model (having begun to work through "Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer"). I've only worked with Quarto briefly, but I love this implementation with Jupyter Lab. Little to no set-up required beyond installing Quarto (and having my existing Python/Anaconda installations), no disruption to current workflow, and great PDF generation through pandoc now with my Python notebooks as well in Jupyter Lab (which I much prefer to Python in RStudio, if I am working with Python alone).
