This website was set up using the <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/">minimal-mistakes theme</a> within <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I found <a href="https://zenglix.github.io">Li Zeng's personal web	site</a> and specifically his <a href="https://zenglix.github.io/personal_website/">Jekyll set-up post</a> extremely helpful in conjunction with the Jekyll & minimal-mistakes documentation. Steven Miller's website and <a href="http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/">walkthrough</a>. While building some familiarity with Jekyll and the ability to generate a website, I also found msyelf consulting this useful <a href="https://ben.balter.com/jekyll-style-guide/">Jekyll style guide</a> as a means of (attempting to) keep myself in check with respect to good practices.

I'm very thankful for the walkthroughs and existing resources that other laypeople have taken the time to outline for users like me to build a professional website with minimal experience in HTML, CSS, etc!
