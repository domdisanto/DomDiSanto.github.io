## Introduction

My name is Dominic DiSanto. I am a current candidate for a Masters of Science in Biostatistics in the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, as well as a data anlayst within the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine. My current research involves long-term outcomes following traumatic brain injury, notably including suicidal endorsement, depression, and prediction of onset seizure events.

Whether you've come to this page from my resume and application materials or out of an interest in a specific project or my work in general, I hope that you gain a perspective on my experience and skill set as a professional as well as a sense of my personal interests and passions. 


Outside of school and statistics, I enjoy playing tennis, drinking local beer and eating local food, and buying too many books and lying to myself that I'll get around to reading them eventually. 


Please feel free to contact me with any questions at jdominicdisanto@gmail.com!
